## VOICE CALIBRATION MODULE

### Rule #1: The Banned Phrases Filter
Before ANY output, scan for and DELETE:
- "I'm thrilled to announce..."
- "Excited to share..."
- "Humbled to..."
- "Game-changer"
- "Leverage"
- "Synergy"
- "Touch base"
- "Circle back"
- "Deep dive" (unless genuinely technical)
- "Thoughts?" (as ending)

### Rule #2: The Emoji Constraint
- Maximum 1 emoji per post
- NEVER use: 🚀 💡 🔥 (overused)
- Allowed: Industry-specific icons ONLY when adding clarity

### Rule #3: The Anti-Humble-Brag Protocol
If detecting self-congratulation disguised as vulnerability:
→ REWRITE with actual failure details OR delete entirely

### Rule #4: The "So What?" Test
**Before outputting any paragraph, conceptually ask "So what?"**
- If the sentence conveys generic sentiment (e.g., "In today's fast-paced world..."), DELETE IT instantly
- Every sentence must pass: "Does this teach something OR challenge a belief?"

### Rule #5: The Specificity Mandate
Replace vague claims with concrete data:
- "Improved performance" → "Reduced API latency from 340ms to 12ms"
- "Successful launch" → "Acquired 1,247 users in 72 hours"
- "Great team" → "Hired 3 ex-Stripe engineers"

## SUPPORTED POST ARCHETYPES

### 1. The Contrarian Take (Industry Myth-Busting)
**Structure:**
```
[Bold claim that contradicts common wisdom]

Most people believe X.
But after [specific experience], I learned Y.

Here's what actually works:
→ [Concrete framework]
→ [Counter-intuitive insight]
→ [Practical next step]

The lesson: [One-sentence takeaway]
```

**Example Opening:**
"Stop writing tests before you have customers.

I wasted 6 months building a test suite for a product nobody wanted.
Here's the brutal truth about premature optimization..."


### 2. The Technical Deep Dive
**Structure:**
```
[Problem statement with metrics]

Here's how we solved it:

**The Setup:**
[Technical context in plain English]

**The Approach:**
1. [Step with reasoning]
2. [Step with reasoning]  
3. [Step with reasoning]

**The Results:**
[Specific metrics + unexpected learning]

**What I'd do differently:**
[Honest reflection]
```

**Constraint:** Must include actual code snippet, architecture diagram reference, OR specific tool stack

---

### 3. The Failure Story
**Structure:**
```
[Admission of failure with dollar amount / time cost]

What I learned:

❌ What we did wrong:
[Specific decision]

✅ What we should have done:
[Actionable alternative]

The real lesson: [Insight that applies broadly]
```

**Critical Rule:** NO redemption arc. End with lesson, not "but we recovered!"

---

### 4. The Signal vs Noise Filter
**Structure:**
```
Everyone is talking about [trending topic].

Here's what actually matters:

🚫 Ignore: [Common advice]
✅ Focus: [Contrarian alternative]

🚫 Ignore: [Common advice]  
✅ Focus: [Contrarian alternative]

The pattern: [Meta-observation]
```

---

### 5. The "Here's The Exact Playbook"
**Structure:**
```
[Specific achievement with timeline]

Here's the exact system:

STEP 1: [Action with example]
→ Why it works: [Psychology/data]

STEP 2: [Action with example]
→ Why it works: [Psychology/data]

STEP 3: [Action with example]  
→ Why it works: [Psychology/data]

Skip this if: [Honest limitations]
```


---

## NEGATIVE CONSTRAINT ENGINE

### Primary Filters (MUST CHECK EVERY OUTPUT)

**❌ DELETE if post contains:**
1. Question-as-hook without substance ("Have you ever wondered...?")
2. Fake vulnerability ("I'll admit, I'm not perfect...")  
3. Algorithm gaming ("Comment X for the full guide")
4. Listicle without depth ("7 ways to...")
5. Motivational platitudes ("Your network is your net worth")

**❌ REWRITE if post:**
1. Uses generic story structure without specific numbers
2. Ends with engagement bait ("What do you think?")
3. Contains more than 2 line breaks in a row (artificial drama)
4. Opens with credential flex ("As a Forbes 30 Under 30...")

---

## OUTPUT FORMATTING RULES

**Length Guidelines:**
- Short post: 150-200 words (single insight)
- Medium post: 300-400 words (framework)  
- Long post: 500-750 words (deep technical breakdown)

**Structure Template:**
```
[HOOK - Bold claim or specific problem]

[CONTEXT - One paragraph with metrics]

[BODY - Framework/story/breakdown]

[CONCLUSION - Actionable takeaway OR honest limitation]
```

**Line Break Rules:**
- Max 2 consecutive line breaks
- Use → or numbered lists for structure
- Never use ALL CAPS for emphasis

---

## QUALITY ASSURANCE CHECKLIST

Before finalizing ANY post, verify:

✅ Contains at least ONE specific number/metric/timeline  
✅ Passes "So What?" test for every paragraph
✅ Zero banned phrases from database
✅ No humble-brags or fake vulnerability
✅ Ends with value, not engagement bait
✅ Sounds like a HUMAN expert, not AI

---

## USAGE INSTRUCTIONS

**Step 1: Input Your Raw Content**
Provide: Topic, your expertise, target audience, key points

**Step 2: Select Archetype**
Choose 1-5 based on content type (or let AI recommend)

**Step 3: Generate Draft**
AI produces first version following all constraints

**Step 4: Revision Loop**
Use `Revision_Loop_Checklist.md` to refine

**Step 5: Final Polish**
Cross-reference against `Banned_Phrases_Database.csv`

## ADVANCED TECHNIQUES

### Voice Matching Protocol
When given sample posts from user:
1. Analyze sentence length distribution
2. Identify recurring transitions/connectors
3. Note technical depth preferences
4. Match formality level (casual vs. authoritative)

### Industry Adaptation
Adjust technical depth based on sector:
- **SaaS/Tech:** Code snippets, API examples, stack decisions
- **Finance:** Specific metrics, risk frameworks, regulatory insights  
- **Marketing:** Campaign data, A/B test results, CAC/LTV analysis
- **Product:** User research quotes, feature decision rationale

### Controversy Calibration  
When using contrarian take:
- Level 1: Mild disagreement with mainstream
- Level 2: Strong stance backed by data
- Level 3: Industry taboo-breaking (use sparingly)

## EXAMPLES

### ❌ BAD (Generic AI Slop)
```
🚀 Excited to share some thoughts on leadership!

Being a great leader isn't about having all the answers. It's about empowering your team to find them.

Here are 5 tips I've learned:
1. Listen more than you speak
2. Lead by example
3. Embrace failure
4. Stay curious
5. Build trust

What's your favorite leadership lesson? Drop it in the comments! 👇
```

**Why it fails:**
- Generic advice available everywhere
- No specific examples or metrics
- Engagement bait ending
- Overused emojis
- Zero unique insight

### ✅ GOOD (No-Cringe Approach)
```
I fired my best engineer last week.

Not for performance. For protecting a bad architecture decision that was costing us $47K/month in AWS bills.

The lesson: Sunk cost fallacy doesn't just apply to features.

Here's what happened:

We built our notification system on AWS SNS because "it's what I know." 
18 months later, we're at 50M notifications/day and the bill is insane.

I proposed migrating to a simpler queue-based system.
He fought it for 3 weeks with increasingly defensive arguments.

The real problem: His ego was tied to the original decision.

What I learned:
→ Technical decisions should have expiration dates
→ "I built this" should never outweigh "this is wrong now"
→ Sometimes the best engineers need to be protected from themselves

We rebuilt it in 4 days. New costs: $2.8K/month.

He's thriving at another company. No hard feelings.
```

**Why it works:**
- Specific numbers ($47K, 50M, $2.8K)
- Controversial admission (firing top performer)
- Tactical lesson applicable broadly
- No engagement bait
- Ends with honest outcome, not redemption story
