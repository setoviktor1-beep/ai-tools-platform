# LinkedIn Post Revision Loop Checklist

**Use this checklist BEFORE publishing any LinkedIn post to ensure maximum quality and authenticity.**

---

## PHASE 1: STRUCTURAL REVIEW

### Hook Quality (First 2 Lines)
- [ ] Opens with specific claim, number, or bold statement
- [ ] NO generic questions ("Have you ever wondered...")
- [ ] NO credential flexing ("As a Forbes 30 Under 30...")
- [ ] Creates immediate curiosity WITHOUT clickbait
- [ ] First sentence under 12 words

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "I'm excited to share..."
- ❌ "Let me tell you a story..."
- ❌ Any form of "In today's world..."

---

### Body Structure
- [ ] Maximum 3 main points/sections
- [ ] Each section has specific example OR data point
- [ ] No more than 2 consecutive line breaks anywhere
- [ ] Uses → or numbered lists (NOT bullet points •)
- [ ] Every paragraph passes "So What?" test

**Line Break Rules:**
```
✅ GOOD:
Text here.

More text here.

✅ GOOD:  
Text here.
→ Point one
→ Point two

❌ BAD:
Text here.


Too much space.
```

---

### Conclusion Quality
- [ ] Ends with actionable insight OR honest limitation
- [ ] NO engagement bait ("What do you think?")
- [ ] NO call-to-action for comments/likes
- [ ] Ties back to opening hook
- [ ] Provides value even if reader skips middle

**Red Flags:**
- ❌ "Thoughts?"
- ❌ "Comment X for the guide"
- ❌ "Tag someone who needs this"
- ❌ "What did I miss?"

---

## PHASE 2: CONTENT AUDIT

### Specificity Check
- [ ] At least ONE specific number/metric/timeline in post
- [ ] No vague claims ("improved performance" → show %)
- [ ] Names of actual tools/frameworks/companies mentioned
- [ ] Dates, dollar amounts, or percentages included
- [ ] Examples are REAL, not hypothetical

**Specificity Test:**
Replace each claim with: "How specifically?"
- "Increased conversion" → By what %?
- "Successful launch" → How many users?
- "Great team" → Who specifically?

---

### Value Density
- [ ] Every sentence teaches OR challenges
- [ ] Zero filler sentences
- [ ] No "throat-clearing" paragraphs
- [ ] Technical depth matches audience expertise
- [ ] Actionable takeaways clearly stated

**Delete immediately if sentence:**
- States obvious truth ("Building products is hard")
- Repeats earlier point without new insight
- Exists only for rhythm/pacing
- Contains only emotional appeal

---

## PHASE 3: BANNED PHRASE SCAN

### Run Against CSV Database
- [ ] Cross-check with `Banned_Phrases_Database.csv`
- [ ] Search for HIGH and CRITICAL severity terms
- [ ] Replace with alternatives from database
- [ ] Re-read after replacements to ensure flow

### Common Violations
- [ ] NO "leverage", "synergy", "circle back"
- [ ] NO "game-changer", "disruptive", "revolutionary"  
- [ ] NO humble-brags ("honored", "humbled", "blessed")
- [ ] NO fake vulnerability ("I'll admit...", "confession time")
- [ ] NO trendy overuse ("deep dive" unless technical)

---

## PHASE 4: AUTHENTICITY VERIFICATION

### Voice Consistency
- [ ] Sounds like actual human, not AI
- [ ] Matches your established writing patterns
- [ ] No sudden formality shifts
- [ ] Maintains consistent technical depth
- [ ] Personality evident (not corporate bland)

**AI Detection Signals:**
- Overly perfect grammar
- No contractions when you normally use them
- Uniform sentence length
- Missing personal quirks/phrases


### Emoji Audit
- [ ] Maximum 1 emoji in entire post
- [ ] NO 🚀 💡 🔥 (overused startup emojis)
- [ ] Emoji adds clarity, not decoration
- [ ] Remove ALL emojis and re-read (does post still work?)

---

### Vulnerability Assessment
- [ ] If sharing failure: Includes $ amount OR time lost
- [ ] NO redemption arc ("but we recovered!")
- [ ] Honest about what you still don't know
- [ ] Not performative ("vulnerability moment")
- [ ] Actual lesson, not humble-brag disguised

**Fake Vulnerability Examples:**
- ❌ "I'm not perfect, but I try my best"
- ❌ "Here's my biggest flaw: I care too much"
- ✅ "Burned $40K on this mistake. Here's what happened."

---

## PHASE 5: FORMATTING POLISH

### Visual Clarity
- [ ] Mobile-friendly (no lines >60 characters)
- [ ] Strategic use of white space
- [ ] Scannable with → or numbers
- [ ] Key points emphasized with structure, not CAPS
- [ ] No walls of text (max 4 lines per paragraph)

### Length Optimization
- [ ] Short post (150-200 words): Single insight
- [ ] Medium post (300-400 words): Framework
- [ ] Long post (500-750 words): Deep technical
- [ ] NEVER over 800 words

---

## PHASE 6: FINAL QUALITY GATES

### The "Would I Click?" Test
Read ONLY the hook.
- [ ] Would you keep reading if someone else wrote this?
- [ ] Does it promise specific value?
- [ ] Is it different from 10 other posts in feed?

### The "Delete Test"
For each paragraph:
- [ ] Delete it. Does post still make sense?
- [ ] If yes → Consider keeping it deleted
- [ ] If no → Paragraph serves critical function

### The "Expert Check"
Would someone in your field:
- [ ] Learn something new from this?
- [ ] Disagree with a specific claim?
- [ ] Want to debate a technical detail?
- (If all NO → post is too generic)

### The "Cringe Scan"
Read out loud.
- [ ] Does any sentence make you cringe?
- [ ] Would you say this to colleague in person?
- [ ] Are you embarrassed by any claim?
- (Fix or delete anything that fails)

---

2. Eliminating remaining fluff
3. Mobile formatting
4. Emoji pruning

### Third Draft → Final
Focus on:
1. Final cringe scan
2. Specificity verification
3. Value density check
4. One last "So What?" pass

---

## PRE-PUBLISH CHECKLIST

### Final Verification (Do This Right Before Hitting Post)
- [ ] Zero banned phrases remain
- [ ] At least 1 specific metric included
- [ ] NO engagement bait in conclusion

---

## EMERGENCY FIXES

### If Post Feels Generic:
1. Add specific $ amount, timeline, or metric
2. Remove first paragraph (often unnecessary)
3. Replace abstract concepts with concrete examples
4. End with honest limitation instead of advice

### If Post Feels Too Long:
1. Delete introduction (start with the insight)
2. Cut to 3 main points maximum
3. Remove repeated concepts
4. Eliminate throat-clearing phrases

### If Post Sounds Like AI:
1. Add contractions (I'm, you're, we've)
2. Break one grammar rule intentionally
3. Use industry-specific jargon naturally
4. Add personal quirk or phrase

---

## ARCHETYPE-SPECIFIC CHECKS

### For Contrarian Takes:
- [ ] Claim is actually controversial (not just "hot take")
- [ ] Backed by specific experience or data
- [ ] Doesn't rely on strawman argument
- [ ] Shows WHY common wisdom is wrong

### For Technical Deep Dives:
- [ ] Code/tools mentioned are real and current
- [ ] Actual technical depth (not surface explanation)
- [ ] Plain English used for complex concepts
- [ ] Includes unexpected insight, not just how-to

### For Failure Stories:
- [ ] Actual consequences stated (time/money)
- [ ] NO redemption arc or silver lining
- [ ] Lesson is broadly applicable
- [ ] Vulnerability is genuine, not performed

---

## POST-PUBLISH LEARNING

### After Posting, Track:
- Engagement pattern (who engaged most?)
- Comments revealing confusion (clarify next time)
- Sections that resonated (double down)
- Unintended interpretations (word choice)

### Red Flags in Comments:
- "Thanks for sharing!" (too generic)
- "Inspiring!" (not substantive enough)
- No debate/discussion (not thought-provoking)

### Green Flags in Comments:
- Specific questions about methodology
- Respectful disagreement with data
- Request for more technical depth
- Stories from others' similar experiences
